Find the largest possible square on a board


Description:

You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.

The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument, respecting those constraints:

• its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),

• "." (representing an empty place) and "o" (representing an obstacle) are the only two allowed characters for the
other lines,

• all of the lines will be the same length (except the first one),

• there will always be at least one line,

• each line is terminated by ’\n’.

You program must print the board, with some "." replaced by "x" to represent the largest square you found.
